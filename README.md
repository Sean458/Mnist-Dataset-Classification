# Mnist-Dataset-Classification
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Approach
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First the dataset was loaded and a 75-25 train-test data split was carried out. Also 10% of the training data was used for validation. 

Next up the optimal value of k was chosen (in this case 3 for the given dataset) and the model was trained. 

The accuracy was determined and random 5 digits were chosen to test the modelâ€™s prediction.


How accurate is this method?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a simple ML algo like KNN, the accuracy obtained in this model (99.26%) is pretty decent using 3 nearest neighbours to find the common class.
