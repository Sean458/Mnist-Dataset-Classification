First the dataset was loaded and a 75-25 train-test data split was carried out. Also 10% of the training data was used for validation. 

Next up the optimal value of k was chosen (in this case 3 for the given dataset) and the model was trained. 

An accuracy of 99.26% was obtained and random 5 digits were chosen to test the modelâ€™s prediction.
